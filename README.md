# Aboutme
About Me 

Clarence is the founder of Bandwagon, Southeast Asia’s leading independent music media company whose vision is to champion and spotlight music in Asia. As an Economics graduate he taught himself to code and laid the 1st lines of code for a gig finder called Bandwagon. Today the platform has expanded and reaches over 500,000 readers monthly and over 6,000,000 impressions monthly on Twitter with staff across 3 countries. Bandwagon covers trends, new music, and feature articles about artists, entertainment brands, thought leaders, and has been referenced by The New York Times, Billboard, Techcrunch, Teen Vogue and more. Clarence was recognised as 1 of 20 Future Shapers by PEAK Magazine in 2019. 

He spearheads Singapore’s national music movement, Hear65, which was a joint campaign between Bandwagon and Singapore’s governing body for music, National Arts Council. It was launched alongside Senior Parliament Secretary Baey Yam Keng and won Best PR Campaign at the Marketing-Interactive PR Awards 2019, the 1st music project to do so in the history of the awards. 

Bandwagon has created content with artists including Liam Gallagher, Dua Lipa, Troy Sivan, Incubus, Imagine Dragons, The Kooks, Why Don’t We, Izzy, 5 Seconds of Summer, Bruno Major, James Bay, Priscilla Abby, Phoenix and more. 

Clarence grew up in a family where his dad was a forex trader and his mum was a stock broker. Investments were part of family life. Clarence’s first encounter with crypto was in 2018 when he bought some Ethereum. However he really got involved in 2021 when he started exploring Alt coins, DeFi, yield farming and NFTs. Besides music, Clarence has a huge passion in crypto & DeFi because financial innovation is no longer just for the wealthy or the institutions. It empowers the everyday man the ability to grow their assets with however much they have and achieve financial freedom. His personal goal is to help his parents, who have left the corporate world to become missionaries in Japan, build passive income through DeFi. Where they can have a growing stream of income without having to deplete their savings and are able to focus fully on their missionary and charitable work.  

# My journey in Crypto

My journey in crypto started with buying some Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017. However it got serious 2021 when a friend introduced me to the world of DeFi and alt coins. I went down the rabbit hole of projects like Theta, Luna, Ziliqa, Secret, Thorchain, FTM. I started yield farming, getting into NFTs, and now its a dream of mine to utilise web3 and innovate within my passions in entertainment and business development. 

So far web3 projects I'm got involved in: 

- TheGreatWave.io, built on Binance Smart Chain, $1M founding liquidity raise. (Founding DAO member and advisor)
- Bandwagon Pixel Party ft MYRNE in Decentraland, 30 Jan 2022, 250 POAPs fully claimed within 20 mins (Founder) 
- Bandwagon upcoming NFT launch in 2Q2022 (Founder)

Crypto communities I'm active in: 

- SG Lunatics
- Galactic Punks
- The Great Wave 

Projects i'm tracking closely in web3 in line with my interests:

- portals (solana) 
- magic eden (solana)
- Pixelbands.io (solana) 
- modadao.io (ethereum)
- royals.io (ethereum)
- Sound.xyz (ethereum)
- Sandbox (ethereum)
- Decentraland  (ethereum / polygon side chain)
- Pavia (cardano) 
- Pylon (launchpad, Terra)
- Starterra (launchpad, Terra)
- Terraworld (metaverse, Terra)
- Lunaverse (metaverse, Terra) 
- Luart (NFT marketplace, Terra)

Problem statements I'm currently thinking about: 

1. How creators can raise capital to fund their creative pursuits via web3. [Please read](https://medium.com/thegreatwave/putting-the-power-back-to-the-creators-5882330bae2 )
2. How fans can have a stake in a musical work and benefit by 'investing' in an artist's development
3. How stream2earn in a metaverse could be the next big leap for music streaming. For this, i have a litepaper of some initial ideas. [Please read here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjcw45dse681rf4/Communify%20Litepaper%20v0.1.pdf?dl=0)

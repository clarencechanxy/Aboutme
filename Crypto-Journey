My journey in crypto started with buying some Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2017. 
However it got serious 2021 when a friend introduced me to the world of DeFi and alt coins. I went down the rabbit hole of projects like Theta, Luna, Ziliqa, Secret, Thorchain, FTM.
I started yield farming, getting into NFTs, and now its a dream of mine to utilise web3 and innovate within my passions in entertainment and business development. 

So far web3 projects I'm got involved in: 
TheGreatWave.io, built on Binance Smart Chain, $1M founding liquidity raise. (Founding DAO member and advisor) 
Bandwagon Pixel Party ft MYRNE in Decentraland, 30 Jan 2022, 250 POAPs fully claimed within 20 mins (Founder) 
Bandwagon upcoming NFT launch in 2Q2022 (Founder) 

Crypto communities I'm active in: 
SG Lunatics
Galactic Punks
The Great Wave 

Projects i'm tracking closely in web3 in line with my interests:
portals (solana) 
royals.io (ethereum)
Sound.xyz (ethereum)
Pixelbands.io (solana) 
Sandbox (ethereum)
Decentraland  (ethereum / polygon side chain)
Pavia (cardano) 
Pylon (launchpad, Terra)
Starterra (launchpad, Terra)

Problem statements I'm currently thinking about: 
1. How creators can raise capital to fund their creative pursuits via web3
2. How fans can have a stake in a musical work and benefit by 'investing' in an artist's development
3. How the music streaming experience can be more immersive (what is the next big leap). For this, i have a litepaper of some initial ideas. Please see here ![communify litepaper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjcw45dse681rf4/Communify%20Litepaper%20v0.1.pdf?dl=0)
